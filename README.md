Repo for Group 6.

Let's decide the fate of the new world! Does it belong to man? Or fish? You made me hit my seaplane! It doesn't matter. 
I've got your woman, killed your friends. Who's gonna stop me now? You?! Not a chance! You don't even have a leg to stand on!
Yes! I, Deacon of WaterWorld, celebrate the brith of a new nation! Dry Land is my destiny!
